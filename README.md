# TheSMSWorks PHP SDK

The SMS Works provides a low-cost, reliable [SMS API for developers](https://thesmsworks.co.uk/). Pay only for delivered texts, all failed messages are refunded.

This package is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/TheSMSWorks/smsw-php-sdk">PHP SDK for the SMS Works Message API</a>,
forked to be compatible with Laravel 8. We don't recommend you use this package since we will remove it once the parent
package has itself been updated by TheSMSWorks.
